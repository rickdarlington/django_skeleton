how to use this project:

It's easy really.  I'll assume you have python installed at this point.

The project is configured for Django 1.8 (see skeleton/settings.py for the context processors change needed to make it  work with 1.7)

You're using virtualenv, right?

1. pip install virtualenvwrapper
2. mkvirtualenv django_skeleton 
    (or whatever name you like)
3. source django_skeleton/bin/activate
4. pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
5. python manage.py migrate
6. python manage.py runserver

There you go.  You've got a bootstrap 3, django 1.8 (+ backbone, jquery, json2js, underscore, etc) project with email signup working.  Go forth and build something great!
